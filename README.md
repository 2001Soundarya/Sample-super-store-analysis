# Sample-super-store-analysis
This visualization project aims to analyze a fictitious superstoreâ€™s sales performance between 2016 and 2019 using Microsoft Power BI.

AYN superstore is located in the United States of America where the shops are distributed in the US and the products are shipped to consumers, corporate and home office items. These items include furniture, technology, and office supplies.

## The three key steps involved in this project include:
- Data Collection
- Data Preparation/Cleaning
- Analysis and Visualization

## Data Collection
The Dataset used in this Dashboard is picked up from Kaggle

## Data Preparation/Cleaning
The Data Cleaning involved tasks like handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting data types, and addressing inconsistencies in columns, ensuring a more accurate and usable dataset for analysis. This phase enabled me to improve the quality of data, and have better insights and decision-making from the Sample SuperStore Dataset.
